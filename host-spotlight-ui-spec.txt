Types of spotlight

  - default
    used on hover elements in the host or on selecting an element in the DOM view

  - Metrics diagram
    used in DOM > Layout to spotlight a given box ( dimension, padding, border, margin)

  - Locked Elements
    to spotlight all the locked elements

Default Spotlight
  There is a setting to turn that on or off, present as switch button in the DOM view and as check box in Settings > DOM.
  The selected element in the DOM view shall only be highlighted while hovering it.
  Hovering an element in a breadcrumb, either in the status bar or in DOM > Layout, shall also spotlight the element.

Metrics diagram
  Hovering a given box in DOM > Layout in the Metrics Diagram shall spotlight the according box in the host. The hover color shall be the same color as on the host side.


Locked Elements
  There is a setting to turn on / off lock elements in the tool-bar in DOM view. If turned on all selected ( clicked ) elements shall be spotlighted at once. This is mainly to check relations between elements. On switching off all locked elements shall be cleared.


Settings
  The setting shows by default two color selects for "fill and frame" and "grid". Selecting a color will generate automatically a color schema. There is also a button to switch back to the initial color schema. 
  The advanced view shows all colors and selects to change them.

Keyboard Shortcuts
  CTRL-I to invert the current used color schema. (works only if the DF window has focus ). The purpose is to be able to switch quickly to an other schema if the current does match e.g. the color schema of the document.

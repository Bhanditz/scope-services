  <h1>
    Practical considerations</h1>
  <h2>
    Programming language</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="architecture.html">The architecture</a> allows tools to be written in any language the author chooses. Previously
    we have tried to standardise on Perl and Pike for core work. For the moment, I do not think the tools work should be restricted
    to those languages. But there are a couple of general restrictions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The resulting tools should run on any reasonable desktop platform: Mac, Unix, Windows. So using some language or toolkit
      not available in a high-quality implementation on all three platforms is not reasonable. If in doubt, ask.</li>
    <li>Some of the tools may in the future be constrained to interoperate with tool platforms like Eclipse. We don't know enough
      about that yet, but this means Java is a good default language if you are worried about future-proofing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The proxy and the prototype tools are all written in Java (except the JavaScript debugger prototype, which is written in
    Python).</p>
  <h2>
    Data representation</h2>
  <p>
    I urge you to consider formatting your data as XML. Structured data is good, and there are good XML kits for most major
    languages as well as inside Opera. The scope module provides an XML parser and representations of XML data built on top
    of facilities already in Java.</p>
  <p>
    The prototype tools currently use XML protocols and provide some good examples. The <a href="xml-style.html">XML protocols
      style guide</a> provides some guidelines for how to write protocols.</p>

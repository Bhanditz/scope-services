Style guide
===========

This document describes the style that should be used to write protocol
specifications and documentation for scope and ``STP/1``.

Protocol specifications
-----------------------

Style guide
^^^^^^^^^^^

The style guide uses elements from the Python Style Guide `PEP 8`_.
Names of services, command, events and messages are all written using
CamelCase_. Fields are also written using CamelCase but the first letter
of the first word uses a non-capital letter, this is also known as mixedCase.
The exception to this rule are abbreviations, we capitalize all the letters
of the abbreviation when used in CamelCase.

Examples of service/command names:

* WindowManager
* EcmascriptDebugger
* WindowInfo

Examples of field names:

* windowID
* windowType

Fields which are of type *Repeated* must always end in *List*, this allows
the type to be extracted by removing the *List* from the name. Examples of
this are:

* windowList -> window
* indexList  -> index

Tags for field and command/event tags must be numbered from 1 and up in order.

Services, commands, events, messages and fields are explained in detail in
:doc:`unified-message-structure`.

Documentation
-------------

The layout on an HTML page should consist of one and only one header 
(``<h1>``), which is the same as the title on the page.

References to ``STP`` versions should be written with a forward slash and in an
HTML ``<code>`` element, like ``STP/1``.

Whenever talking about Opera Dragonfly, be sure to include the Opera-prefix.

Every HTML page must have the following header, placed right after the ``<body>`` tag::

   <p class="logo">
      <img src="http://www.opera.com/media/images/logo/ologo_wback.gif">
   </p>

And the following footer::

    <div id="footer">Copyright Â© 2009 Opera Software ASA. All rights reserved.</div>

Some documents have changelogs. These should be removed. We can rely on external changelogs from Mercurial.

Every document should clearly show the status of the document. It should be one of "Draft", "Discontinued", or "In use". If "Discontinued", it should state in which versions it was last available. If "Discontinued" or "In use", it should state in which version it was introduced. This information should be presented as a definition list::

     <div class="docdata">
     <dl>
        <dt>Status</dt><dd>STATUS</dd>
        <dt>Introduced</dt><dd>CORE-VERSION</dd>
        <dt>Last version</dt><dd>CORE-VERSION</dd>
     </dl>
     </div>

Style guide
===========

This document describes the style that should be used to write protocol
specifications and documentation for scope and ``STP/1``.

Protocol specifications
-----------------------

Documentation
-------------

The layout on an HTML page should consist of one and only one header 
(``<h1>``), which is the same as the title on the page.

References to ``STP`` versions should be written with a forward slash and in an
HTML ``<code>`` element, like ``STP/1``.

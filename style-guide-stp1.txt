Style guide
===========

This document describes the style that should be used to write protocol
specifications and documentation for scope and ``STP/1``.

Protocol specifications
-----------------------

Documentation
-------------

The layout on an HTML page should consist of one and only one header 
(``<h1>``), which is the same as the title on the page.

References to ``STP`` versions should be written with a forward slash and in an
HTML ``<code>`` element, like ``STP/1``.

Whenever talking about Opera Dragonfly, be sure to include the Opera-prefix.

Every HTML must have the following header, placed right after the ``<body>`` tag::

   <p class="logo">
      <img src="http://www.opera.com/media/images/logo/ologo_wback.gif">
   </p>

And the following footer::

	<div id="footer">Â© Opera Software ASA</div>

Deprecation
+++++++++++

If the document has been deprecated, the following section should appear right below the ``h1``::

   <p class="deprecated">Deprecated</p>

Style guide
===========

This document describes the style that should be used to write protocol
specifications and documentation for scope and ``STP/1``.

Protocol specifications
-----------------------

Documentation
-------------

The layout on an HTML page should consist of one and only one header 
(``<h1>``), which is the same as the title on the page.

References to ``STP`` versions should be written with a forward slash and in an
HTML ``<code>`` element, like ``STP/1``.

Whenever talking about Opera Dragonfly, be sure to include the Opera-prefix.

Every HTML page must have the following header, placed right after the ``<body>`` tag::

   <p class="logo">
      <img src="http://www.opera.com/media/images/logo/ologo_wback.gif">
   </p>

And the following footer::

    <div id="footer">Â© Opera Software ASA</div>

Some documents have changelogs. These should be removed. We can rely on external changelogs from Mercurial.

Every document should clearly show the status of the document. It should be one of "Draft", "Discontinued", or "In use". If "Discontinued", it should state in which versions it was last available. If "Discontinued" or "In use", it should state in which version it was introduced. This information should be presented as a definition list::

     <div class="docdata">
     <dl>
        <dt>Status</dt><dd>STATUS</dd>
        <dt>Introduced</dt><dd>CORE-VERSION</dd>
        <dt>Last version</dt><dd>CORE-VERSION</dd>
     </dl>
     </div>
